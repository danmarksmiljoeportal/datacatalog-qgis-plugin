# Introduction
The "DMP Catalogue" is a QGIS plugin that allows the user to easily find and add any WMTS-, WFS-, and WMS-layer that is available in the DMP data catalogue from a single place.

The plugin adds a button to the QGIS toolbar, with which you can enable the plugin. The plugin is a dockable window in QGIS, that by default is shown in the right hand side of QGIS when enabled.

The plugin allows you to explore the datasets (layers) and collections (groups of layers) in a tree, and also search for specific layers by name.

# Installation
The plugin is installed using the QGIS plugin manager.

Goto to Plugins > "Manage and Install Plugins" click on "All" and search for "DMP Data Catalogue".

You can also try latest development versions by downloading and installing the plugin in QGIS from a zip file. 

These are available here https://github.com/danmarksmiljoeportal/datacatalog-qgis-plugin/releases, download the zip-file "dmpcatalogue.zip" for the release you want to try.
